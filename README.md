# A collection of numerical analysis 

Numerical analysis is the study of algorithms that use numerical approximation (as opposed to symbolic manipulations) for the problems of mathematical analysis. 

This includes topics such as algorithms for statistics, analytic number theory, and machine learning. The restriction is: content must be analytic, algorithms use numbers.
